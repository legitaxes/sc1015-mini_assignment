## üìÉ Report :

### ‚≠ê **Introduction:** 

The dataset we are using is a dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ruchi798/data-science-job-salaries) where it is a dataset of data science jobs. We are predicting `salary_in_usd` against other variables using various models we have been taught as well as other models that are not taught in the course.

We aim to answer which feature in the dataset is correlated to `salary_in_usd`, and does `salary_in_usd` increase or decrease based on the features. Additionally, we created various new features and transformed many variables to be able to fit into the model.  Below is a table for reference on what features are created:

| No. 	| Features Created     	| Remarks                                                                                                                                                                              	|
|-----	|----------------------	|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------	|
| 1.  	| `salary_group`       	| A classification of the different salary group ranging from "low", "low-mid", "mid", "mid-high", "high" as well as a label "outlier" if its beyond or below upper/lower bound of IEQ 	|
| 2.  	| `compare_avr_salary` 	| Splits salary between above or below Singapore's average salary (referenced from [here](https://www.worlddata.info/average-income.php))                                              	|
| 3.  	| `company_continent`  	| Classify the company location into different continent. <br>i.e. "AFRICA", "ASIA", "AUSTRALIA", "EUROPE", "NORTH AMERICA", "SOUTH AMERICA"                                           	|
| 4.  	| `employee_continent` 	| Classify the location of where the employee is working into different continents. <br>i.e. "AFRICA", "ASIA", "AUSTRALIA", "EUROPE", "NORTH AMERICA", "SOUTH AMERICA"                 	|
| 5.  	| `domain`             	| Classify `job_title` into different domains. <br>i.e. "Management", "Data Science", "Computer Vision", "AI", "Machine Learning", "NLP", "Unknown"                                    	|
| 6.  	| `job_type`           	| Classify `job_title` into different job types. <br>i.e. "Head", "Manager", "Developer", "Analyst", "Scientist", "Consultant", "Engineer"                                             	|


We would also like to explore which feature is the most significant in deciding `salary_in_usd` that would benefit data science students when searching for a job. Finally, we compare the salary in data science to the average salary in Singapore to determine whether Data Science job salaries are being paid higher or lower than the average Singapore income. (Average salary per annum referenced from [here](https://www.worlddata.info/average-income.php)).


### üîé **Data Analysis:** 

We started by cleaning the dataset by transforming the data to make it usable for our models. 
Below is a table of a summary of what feature was transformed:
| No. 	| Features Transformed to Categorical 	| New Feature Name to Classify 	| Remarks                                                                                                                                                                                                         	|
|-----	|-------------------------------------	|------------------------------	|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------	|
| 1.  	| `experience_level`                  	| `experience_levelN`          	| 5 different categories created <br>    1. 0 ( Entry Level )<br>    2. 1 ( Junior MI Mid Level )<br>    3. 2 ( Intermediate SE Senior-level )<br>    4. 3 ( Expert EX Executive-level )<br>    5. 4 ( Director ) 	|
| 2.  	| `company_size`                      	| `company_sizeN`              	| 3 different categories created <br>    1. 0 - S less than 50 employees (small) <br>    2. 1 - M 50 to 250 employees (medium) <br>    3. 2 - L more than 250 employees (large)                                   	|
| 3.  	| `employement_type`                  	| `employment_typeN`           	| 4 different categories created <br>    1. 0 - PT Part-time <br>    2. 1 - FT Full-time <br>    3. 2 - CT Contract <br>    4. 3 - FL Freelance                                                                   	|
| 4.  	| `remote_ratio`                      	| NIL                          	| 3 different categories created <br>    1. 0 - No remote work / less than 20%<br>    2. 1 - 50% Partially remote <br>    3. 2 - 100% Fully remote (more than 80%)                                                	|
| 5.  	| `company_continent`                 	| `company_continentN`         	| 6 different categories created<br>    1. 0 : Europe<br>    2. 1 : Asia<br>    3. 2 : North America<br>    4. 3 : Australia<br>    5. 4 : South America<br>    6. 5 : Africa                                     	|
| 7.  	| `employee_continent`                	| `employee_continentN`        	| 6 different categories created <br>    1. 0 : Europe<br>    2. 1 : Asia<br>    3. 2 : North America<br>    4. 3 : Australia<br>    5. 4 : South America<br>    6. 5 : Africa                                    	|

We have also analyzed what are the distributions of the variables are like to see where majority of our data are for each variable. For example, `salary_group` majority of the datapoints are in the low-mid range. 

Exploratory Data Analysis techniques such as plotting various box plots and heatmaps of `salary_in_usd` to other variables to see the salary are at for each data category of the variable we are comparing to. 
Then based on the EDA we will be able to see which variable we should include or exclude from our model.


### üîÆ **Prediction Models:**

We used `Random Forest Regressor` as our base model to compare to the rest of the models done in this project. All of the models  we did were all further improved using `k-fold cross validation` and `gridsearch`. The improvement of the model can be seen by the accuracy increase or whether the R^2 value is more realistic.

The models we have implemented to compare to the base model are as follows:

1. Linear Regression

2. Decision Tree Regressor
  
3. Support Vector Machine


### üéë **Bonus: Logistic Regression Model**

We also attempted to predict whether the `salary_in_usd` will be higher or lower than Singapore's average salary. We started by transforming `salary_in_usd` into a variable called `compare_avr_salary` which is a binary classifier that indicates if a salary is`above average` or `below average`. We then created a logistic regression model to predict whether `salary_in_usd` will be above or below average. The model accuracy was also further improved by using `k-fold cross validation` and `gridsearch` (to select best hyperparameters for the model).

### üìù <u>**Conclusion:**</u>

In conclusion, we found that the feature that had the highest correlation with salary was the number of years of experience (`experience_level`). And the best model we should use to predict `salary_in_usd` is our base model which is `Random Forest Regressor` with the highest R^2 value score out of all the models we have computed.

We also found out whether the salary range was most influenced by job title and industry that the people who are working in and the average salary in the data science field is about 80% higher than the average salary in Singapore.
