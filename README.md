### üìÉ Report :

‚≠ê <u>**Introduction:** </u>

The dataset we are using is a dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ruchi798/data-science-job-salaries) where it is a dataset of data science jobs. We are predicting `salary_in_usd` against other variables using various models we have been taught as well as other models that are not taught in the course.

We aim to answer which feature in the dataset is correlated to `salary_in_usd`, and does `salary_in_usd` increase or decrease based on the features. Additionally, we created various new features and transformed many variables to be able to fit into the model. We would like to explore which feature is the most significant in deciding `salary_in_usd` that would benefit data science students when searching for a job. Finally, we compare the salary in data science to the average salary in Singapore to determine whether Data Science job salaries are being paid higher or lower than the average Singapore income. (Average salary per annum referenced from [here](https://www.worlddata.info/average-income.php)).

üîé <u>**Data Analysis:** </u>

We started by cleaning the dataset and transforming the data to make it usable for our models. Then, Exploratory Data Analysis techniques were done i.e exploring box plots and heatmaps of `salary_in_usd` to other variables. From the EDA we are able to see which variable we should include or exclude from our model.

üîÆ <u>**Prediction Models:**</u>

We used `Random Forest Regressor` as our base model to compare the rest of the models done here. The model was also further improved using `k-fold cross validation` and `gridsearch`, improvement of the model can be seen by the accuracy.

  
  

The models we tested to be used to compare are as follows (each with `k-fold cross validation` and `gridsearch` done to further improve the accuracy):

1. Linear Regression

2. Decision Tree Regressor
  
3. Support Vector Machine

üéë <u>**Other Prediction Models:**</u>

We also attempted to transform the salary data into a binary classifier (labelled as `above average` or `below average`) and created a logistic regression model to predict whether `salary_in_usd` will be above or below average. The model accuracy was also further improved by using `k-fold cross validation` and `gridsearch`.

üìù <u>**Conclusion:**</u>

In conclusion, we found that the feature that had the highest correlation with salary was the number of years of experience (`experience_level`). And the best model we should use to predict `salary_in_usd` is `Decision Tree Regressor` with the highest R^2 value score.

We also found out whether the salary range was most influenced by job title and industry that the people who are working in and the average salary in the data science field is about 80% higher than the average salary in Singapore.

  

### ‚ùìQuestions we are exploring:

1. Which feature is correlated to salary (numerical)? and does the salary increase or decrease based on the feature?

2. Which feature is the most significant in deciding the range of the salary? (categorical)

3. Explore general summary of whether data science students, what are some qualities that would benefit them if they pay attention to when they are looking for a job.

4. What is the salary in Data Science jobs like compared to the average in Singapore?

5. Which model performs the best compared to the base model (Random Forest Regressor)?
